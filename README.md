# password-generator
This is my first ever C# program, which leverages the .NET framework to create secure, random passwords using lower and uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols commonly allowed by most websites. It's a console app that prompts to you enter the length of your desired password and responds with a generated password of your desired length.
